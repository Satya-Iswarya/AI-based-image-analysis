# Smart Selfie Capture
This repository contains the implementation of my Infosys project, which involves building a Python-based application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and computer vision features. 
The project integrates OpenCV, Tkinter, and custom-trained models for tasks like face detection, smile detection, and age prediction.
# Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV

Smile detection with a trained CNN model

Age prediction model integration

GUI built using Tkinter for user interaction

Live video feed with FPS & processing time display

Options to capture images and manage dataset

Easy-to-use buttons for controlling the camera

# Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV – for computer vision tasks

Tkinter – for GUI

Deep Learning Models (Smile & Age Prediction)

Threading – to handle real-time video and GUI responsiveness

# Future Enhancements

Add gender prediction

Improve model accuracy

Enhance UI design with more controls
